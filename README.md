### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ben LeStage, I am a seventh grade history teacher and admissions associate at Indian Mountain School in Lakeville, CT. On campus, I also Coach Varsity Hockey and JV Boys Lacrosse, advise a group of students, and work as a dorm parent. Living on campus is great and the location of school is ideal as it allows me to fly fish almost daily on the famous Housatonic river.

I graduated from St Lawrence University in May of 2024 with a degree in Government/Political Science, in my studies at St. Lawrence I graduated with a minor in Statistics with a focus in Data Science.

Most of my work has been focused on combining my interests in both Government and Statistics largely focused on Data surrounding the Supreme Court and creating models to predict certiorari votes and exploring other relationships.

In my current role, I am using R to analyze data in the admissions office.
